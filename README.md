# Simple VR interaction using gaze-based and distance-based animation triggering

1. Run the executable file while the Oculus Rift headset is connencted.
2. Once the game scene boots up, you'll find yourself on a pirate ship. 
3. You can also see your virtual hands rendered onto the controller's position
4. Look to the right and you'll see a robot starting to wave at you. Pretty random isn't it?
5. Look at the ocean on your left. There will be a humpback whale expressing his happiness. 
6. However, if you move your hands to close, the whale will run away from you. He does not feel comfortable with strangers.
7. Although, he has ran away from you, he will eventually come back as long as you keep your distance from him.
